Python program
You roll a dX and you want to know the statistics around the probability of rolling each number
Especially, that d20.

So you roll, show the roll in a GUI form to the player.
Then using a python library, you start showing the distribution of the rolls in chart form.

Thinking outloud:
DONE - Need to simulate rolling a randon d20

- Need a way to record how many of each number is rolled and recorded

- Maintain how many rolls there have been so far
  - Example of 20 rolls
    - 1 [1] x1
    - 2
    - 3 [3] x2
    - 4 [4] x2
    - 5 [5] x1
    - 6
    - 7
    - 8
    - 9 [9] x1
    - 10 [10] x3
    - 11 [11] x2
    - 12 [12] x2
    - 13 [13] x1
    - 14
    - 15 [15] x1
    - 16 [16] x2
    - 17
    - 18 [18] x1
    - 19 [19] x1
    - 20

- Figure out how to handle dice input that is <= 0.
