# The-d20
This is to simulate a random roll of a x-sided die and then visually show the probability of each number being rolled through collected data.
This program is currently being built inside of Replit.

I am an emerging Data Analyst and programmer and as a start, I have decided to build a program that incorporates DnD and skills I am looking to improve in!

This project is to combine multiple tools to create:

  Graphical User Interface to input the number of dice rolled and what the roll was using <something> #02/09/2022
  
  To dynamically update data visuals on the GUI to see what the probability of y-number being rolled from a x-die using Python Libraries
