Read about namespaces in Python
    Why does:
        global count
        count = 0
        def count():
        ...  count += 1
        ...  print(count)

Iterate through collections.Counter(): https://bit.ly/3oCdVi5
    
    >>>def counterIterator(): 
    ...  import collections
    ...  counter = collections.Counter()
    ...  counter.update(('u1','u1'))
    ...  counter.update(('u2','u2'))
    ...  counter.update(('u2','u1'))
    ...  for ele in counter:
    ...    print(ele,counter[ele])
    >>>counterIterator()
    u1 3
    u2 3

Testing through iterations
    c = counter_test(2)
    c = counter_test(1)
    c = counter_test(1)
    c = counter_test(1)
    print(c)
    #print(c[1]) #this is returning how many times 1 showed up. Should be 3
    for i in c:
        print("Item " + str(i) + " Item count " + str(c[i]))


Random roll alternative:
    #sides = range(1,11)
    #num_throws = 1000
    #counter = Counter(random.choices(sides, k=num_throws))
